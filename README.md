# Assignment2

Description:

This Java program consists of three parts designed to perform various operations on arrays:

part1: Divides the input array into two separate arrays containing even and odd numbers respectively.
part2: Finds the index of the first pair of elements in the array where the absolute difference between the elements is 1.
part3: Allows the user to input a list of integers dynamically.

Usage:

part1(int[] data):
Input: an integer array data.
Output: Prints the original array, an array containing only even numbers, and an array containing only odd numbers.

int part2(int[] data):
Input: an integer array data.
Output: Returns the index (1-based) of the first pair of elements in the array where the absolute difference between them is 1. If no such pair exists, returns -1.

ArrayList<Integer> part3():
Input: User input via console.
Output: Returns an ArrayList of integers entered by the user.
